Write a program that reads a text file and rewrites it with their lines sorted in alphabetical order.  When called with no arguments, it should read from the standard input file and write to the standard output file.  When called with one file-name argument, it should read from that file and write to the standard output file.  When called with two file-name arguments, it should read from the first file and write to the second one.
